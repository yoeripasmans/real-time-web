# Real Time Web course repo

This is the course repo for the 2018 edition of the course 'Real Time Web' which is part of the minor 'web' taught at the University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam.

During this course, students will:
* Build a Node Web App which consumes an external data source through an API and serves a frontend using routing and templating techniques.
* Create a "live" web app which reflects changes to the back-end data model in reactive front-end views, using real-time, event-based, messaging technologies like sockets or server-sent-events.
* Describe their work in a professional readme with insightful diagrams showing the life cycle of their data.
